    * 
    * For tail winds add 75% of the speed  to your distance, so  in a 12mph wind expect the ball to travel an additional 9  yds.
    * For a full on head wind , expect it to reduce your shot by 150-200% of the speed. So hitting into a 12mph wind will reduce the distance 18yd. The stronger the wind the more you reduce but 150% minimum
    * For cross winds I use draw/fade into the wind and the first line left or right on the grid will compensate for 12-13 mph.
    * For winds that are not directly head, tail or cross you use a combination of the formulas, but the only way to find out what works for you is practice, practice, practice
